This package is only useful on Freifunk Aachen supernodes.

It contains configuration files with site-specific settings, which are
not properly documented. So adapting it to a different site may be a
lot of work.

After installing the package, a few manual steps are necessary:

- the slack webhook url must be set in /root/.slack-webhook-url
- /var/lib/ff-watchdog/staging must contain a clone of
  ffac/fastd-peers-clients.git, setup with proper permissions to
  allow for password-less pushes.
  (e.g., remote url could be something like
  git@github-fastd-peers:ffac/fastd-peers-clients.git where
  github-fastd-peers is an alias defined in /root/.ssh/config with an
  identity file containing an authorized key)
- /etc/fastd/.peers/fastd-peers-clients is the clone of ffac/fastd-peers-clients.git
  which is actually used by fastd. I must be owned by the user fastd,
  and setup to allow for a simple 'git pull' as that user. Write access
  to github is not necessary.
